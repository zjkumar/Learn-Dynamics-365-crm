_To return a URI encoded version by replacing URL-unsafe characters with escape characters, we can use either encodeUriComponent or uriComponent functions in expressions._

# Use Case and Benefits:

**Web Request Handling:** The special characters(&, /, ? or Space) in the URI have special meaning and encoding them makes it easy to use in API's or web requests so the browsers can easily understand them.

**Avoid Errors:** If a URI contains reserved or unsafe characters like &, /, ?, or spaces, using encodeUriComponent prevents them from being misinterpreted, which could otherwise result in errors or unexpected behavior.

**Security:** Encoding the URI can help avoid injection attacks or incorrect parsing by web services.
