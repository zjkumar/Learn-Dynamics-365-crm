# Why we need to Create Security Key before registered the plugin?

- Security key establishes trust between the assembly and the CRM environment.
- Security key creates a unique identity for the assembly.
- A strong named assembly has unique identity which includes assembly name, digital signature, version, public key.


### Benefits :
-   It helps to maintain multiple versions of the same assembly to coexist without any conflict.
-   It verifies the assembly with its digital signature ensuring the code is not tampered and is trustworthy.
