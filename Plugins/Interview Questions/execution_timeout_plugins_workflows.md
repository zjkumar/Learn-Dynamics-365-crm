# What is the execution timeout of Async and Sync Plugins and workflows?

**Timeout of Async and Sync Plugins :**
-  The time allowed for both Async and Sync plugins to complete execution is 2 minutes.

**Timeout of Async and Sync Workflows :**
- The time allowed for each step or action in a workflow is restricted to complete its execution in a 2 minute time limit.
- Which means, the time limit is not on the overall workflow, instead it is on each step.
- So the overall workflow may take more than 2 minutes of time to complete execution of all its steps or actions.
