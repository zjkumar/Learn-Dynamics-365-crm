# What are the Limitations of Plugins?
- Needs coding knowledge like c#, where non-developers cannot build the plugins
- May impact the system performance.
- Cannot interact with the client side UI, cannot prompt users for input or display any message.
- Limited built-in error handling, and must implement custom error handling.
- Plugins running in the sandbox mode have less access to the resources.
