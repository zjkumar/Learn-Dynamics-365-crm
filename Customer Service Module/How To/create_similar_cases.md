how to create similar cases ?

create a new case -> then go to customer service admin center -> navigate to case settings -> advanced similarity rules (click manage) -> create a new rule (give a name, description) -> in the match fields tab -> add text analytics entity mapping.(choose an entity, and a field from the entity)  (using this mapping, the system will display similar cases to the current case)


_It shows similar cases to the current case_
_You will be allowed to link the current case with similar cases_
