# Commands:

- Commands drive core application behavior for model driven apps.

- These are the buttons users can interact with, to trigger actions.

- Commands are organized and placed on a command bar.


**_You can customize commands in 3 areas_** :

- 1. Display : You can customize how a button should look. Example : button's label, icon, its position on the command bar.

- 2. Action : You can customize what task should be performed on the click of a command. Example : creating (New +), updating (Save), Deleting (delete).

- 3. Visibility : You can show or hide a command for users under specific conditions.



## Types of Commands :

- **Command :** It is the standard button which can also be part of a dropdown menu or split button.

- **Dropdown :** When clicked, shows a menu with group of commands.

- **Split Button :** It has a primary command with an arrow. Clicking the primary command performs an action, and clicking the arrow opens a menu of commands.




## Command Bar locations :

- **Main grid :** This is the command bar you see when looking at a full list of records in the app.

- **Main Form :** This command bar appears at the top of the main form for a table. Itâ€™s different from the command bars you see in other parts of the form.

- **Subgrid View :** This command bar shows up on forms that include a subgrid. For example, on an account form, you might see a subgrid with related contact records.
