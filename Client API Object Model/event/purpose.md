An event is an action or occurrence that happens in the system, like:

## Form Events :

**OnLoad:** _When a form is loaded._

**OnSave:** _When a form is saved._

**OnChange:** _When a field value changes._

**OnClick:** _When a button is clicked._



## Tab Events :

**OnRecordSelect:** _The OnRecordSelect event occurs when a single row (record) is selected in an editable grid. This event doesn't occur if a user selects different cells in the same row, or selects multiple rows._



```
- The event context is the environment or situation in which the event occurs. 
- It provides info about the event and the state of the application at the time the event happens.
```
