***It has 4 tabs.***
***Security roles, Form order, Fallback forms, Form access checker.***

### 1. Security roles : 
**You can choose if the current form is available to everyone or only to specific security roles.**

### 2. Fallback forms :
**If a user doesn't fall under any security role, he must be shown a default form, which we define here. If an entity has only one form, then it is automatically defined here. But if you choose not to show him because its important form, you need to create another form and disable the important form and enable the new form. This is only available for main forms and does not apply to Quick Create, Quick View or Card forms.**
